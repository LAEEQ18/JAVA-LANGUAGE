SOME JAVA WORK USING HASHSETS etc
The lab 05 : (using array list methods following are described)
{
ARRAY LIST METHODS USING:
we will use student class that we created in the previous lab.
We will create a new class of student organizer and we will create arrays list in this class.
And then we will create add and remove method.
We will use for each loop to remove a particular student from the collection of objects.
Remember that a for each loop traversed a collection of objects.
We will write a method of count the total numbers of students.
Then write a method to print the results of students and make use of the method in the previous lab of print result with for each loop.
Now pass the name the of the student as a parameter and  again make use of the print method of the previous lab.
Now write a method to print the result of all the students.
Now write a method that will search the student on the base of first name. and pass appropriate message on founding the name.
Write a method of print duplicate for the instance if there are more than one student with the same name.
Write a method to print the average marks of the student in the specific subject. Give subject name as a input.
And at the end write a method to get the average marks of the student in the collection. And apply the appropriate formula to get the average marks
